    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Baljit Singh</strong>, a dedicated and detail-oriented web developer and digital media student based in Canada. I'm currently pursuing the <strong>MTM program at Algonquin College</strong>, where I specialize in front-end development, UX/UI design, and digital marketing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have experience building modern, responsive websites and applications using technologies like <strong>Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS, Eleventy,</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>. I enjoy creating clean, fast, and user-friendly digital experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my recent academic projects include a static site generator using Eleventy, a Vue-based contact book app, and a business marketing plan for a fictional agency called <strong>Pixel Perfect</strong>. I’m also skilled in building marketing funnels, brand assets, and digital content strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and helping small businesses grow through effective digital solutions. Whether it's coding, content creation, or strategic planning, I strive to bring both creativity and precision to every project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of tech, I value personal development and wellness, and I’ve completed coursework in physical fitness, injury prevention, and stress management.
